## Over onto the tech side, the stack:

Bono is built using a combination of the T3 stack and our own hand-picked libraries – mainly a combo of Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Next.js. Why? Because it's awesome!

### 1. **Tailwind CSS: Make It Look Cool 🎨**

- With Tailwind CSS, we can make things look really cool! It helps us create a unique, visually stunning look without any hassle. With tailwind all of our css is unduped and we have atomic control over these classes. Allowing for a smaller CSS bundle size.

- Wanna play around with designs? Check out [create.t3.gg](https://create.t3.gg). It's where design dreams come true!

### 2. **TypeScript: Keeps Things Strong 💪**

- TypeScript is like our superhero – it catches errors before they can cause trouble. It makes sure Bono runs smoothly and without any hiccups.

### 3. **Next.js: Super Fast and Easy ⚡**

- Bono is all about speed, and Next.js delivers! It makes our app load super fast and keeps the development process simple. That way, we can focus on giving you a great user experience.

### 4. **Shadcn.UI: Easy and User-Friendly 🌐**

- To make sure everyone can enjoy Bono, we use Shadcn.UI for our components. It's not just about looking good; it's about being easy to use for everyone. Bono is made for everyone – users with disabilities who use screen readers and such can still access our components, you can even use the app only using your keyboard!

## What are you waiting for?

With all of this and so much more, you can be assured that Bono will provide you with the perfect online culinary experience. Dive into our app and enjoy the mix of tech and deliciousness! 🍽️✨
